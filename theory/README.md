# Theory

## DukeOwens
- This folder contains a version of inclusive DIS that implements Q2 evolution in a parametric form.
- It shows how to implement a differentiable local orthogonal inverse transform sampling.

## PixelatedGPD
- This folder contains (WIP) code for implementing pixelated double distributions and GPDs.
- Implementation is in PyTorch for use in AI/ML.
- Evolution code is also in progress.
